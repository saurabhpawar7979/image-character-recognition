# image-character-recognition
<b>In this project how workflow of this project working simple expanation</b>

<p>In this project we give image in this project then how many characters are in the image those character recognised by this code snippet</p>

# Tesseract-ocr
<p>1)Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.  
2)It is free software, released under the apache license, version 2.0, and development has been sponsored by google since 2006.
3)In our project we used pytesseract module for character recognition.
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.

# Python-tesseract 
is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others. Additionally, if used as a script, Python-tesseract will print the recognized text instead of writing it to a file.</p>

# Process  
   First install the tesseract-ocr-setup-4.0.0-alpha
   Set environment for tesseract-ocr.
   Install pytesseract module on PyCharm. 
   Copy image from pc. 
   Write a code.
   Get output in the form of text.
